# Custom Discord Reminder Bot app

This is a modified version of [Discord's example app](https://github.com/discord/discord-example-app) part of the getting started tutorial how to build a rock-paper-scissors game with JavaScript available at [the getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

The goal is to create a simple reminder bot that can set a recurring reminder with a custom message via slash commands and post the message to a text channel at the specified date and time.

Official documentation of the source project is available [here](https://github.com/discord/discord-example-app?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-app-for-discord).
